# FWB.Player.Job

This namespace is part of the normal public player API.

In the current bridge build, job lookups are handled by the built-in framework layer. Most servers do not need unlocked override code for this namespace.

## Public Calls

```lua
FWB.Player.Job.Name()
FWB.Player.Job.Label()
FWB.Player.Job.GradeLabel()
FWB.Player.Job.GradeLevel()
FWB.Player.Job.Data()
```

Server:

```lua
FWB.Player.Job.Data(source)
FWB.Player.Job.Name(source)
FWB.Player.Job.GradeLevel(source)
FWB.Player.Job.Set(source, jobName, grade)
FWB.Player.ToggleDuty(source)
FWB.Player.IsOnDuty(source)
FWB.Player.IsBoss(source)
FWB.Job.PlayerCount(jobName)
```
