# 🔧 Installation

This page covers the recommended Bridge installation flow for FiveM servers.

## Before You Start

1. Ensure `fs_bridge` as the last resource in your server.cfg.
2. Keep `fs_bridge` and your related FS scripts inside the same \[fs] folder.
3. Keep supported selectors on 1 for auto-detect unless support tells you to change them.

After setup, restart the server, review Bridge output in `F8` and the server console, and use `/fs_bridge_c` or `fs_bridge_s` if you want to confirm detected modules.

## Required Base Resources

Make sure these are already installed before Bridge:

| Type             | Required                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Database library | `oxmysql`                               |
| Framework        | `es_extended`, `qb-core`, or `qbx_core` |
| Bridge resource  | `fs_bridge`                             |

## Start Order Rules

Ensure your \[fs] folder, including Bridge and your other FS resources, is placed near the bottom of your server.cfg, with `fs_bridge` ensured last.

Example order:

```
ensure [framework]
ensure [standalone]
ensure [fs]
ensure fs_bridge
```

## Keep Everything In The Same `[fs]` Folder

Recommended layout:

```
resources/
`-- [fs]/
    |-- fs_bridge
    |-- your_fs_script_1
    |-- your_fs_script_2
    `-- your_fs_script_3
```

Keeping Bridge and your related scripts in the same `[fs]` folder makes the setup easier to manage, and your scripts can wait for Bridge to start properly.

## ESX, QBCore, And Qbox Setup

The setup flow is the same for ESX, QBCore, and Qbox.

1. drag and drop the resource into your server
2. make sure `oxmysql` and your framework are already working
3. keep all supported selectors on `1` for auto detect
4. only use manual selection if a support team member tells you to

Example:

```lua
selected_key = 1
```

## Restart And Verify

After installation:

1. restart your server
2. check Bridge debug prints in `F8`
3. check Bridge debug prints in the server console

You can also use these commands to check detected modules:

| Command        | Where To Use It | Purpose                            |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `/fs_bridge_c` | In-game chat    | Check client-side detected modules |
| `fs_bridge_s`  | Server console  | Check server-side detected modules |

## Quick Checklist

* `oxmysql` is installed
* `es_extended`, `qb-core`, or `qbx_core` is installed
* `fs_bridge` is inside `[fs]`
* supported resources start before Bridge
* `fs_bridge` is ensured last
* selectors stay on `1` unless support tells you otherwise
* debug output looks correct in `F8` and the server console
