# Client

This page documents the public client-side Player API.

### Request

`FWB.Player.Request.*` is the current request API and uses one options table only.

Important behavior split:

- New `FWB.Player.Request.*` uses one options table only.
- The extra second `timeout` argument is not part of the new contract.
