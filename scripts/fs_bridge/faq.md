Below you'll find answers to the most common Bridge setup and usage questions.

Click a question to expand it.

***

<details>

<summary><strong>Do I need to edit locked Bridge files?</strong></summary>

No. A normal public setup should use:

* `config/sh_config.lua`
* `unlocked/client.lua`
* `unlocked/server.lua`

Locked Bridge files should be left unchanged in normal installs.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Should I keep supported selectors on 1?</strong></summary>

Yes. `1` is the recommended default because it lets Bridge auto-detect supported resources.

Only switch to a manual option if a support team member tells you to.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>When do I need to write an override?</strong></summary>

Use an override when:

* your resource is unsupported
* auto-detect cannot resolve your setup
* you need custom integration behavior

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>When do I not need an override?</strong></summary>

If your resource is already supported and Bridge works correctly through config and auto-detect, you normally do not need an override.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Where do I paste override snippets?</strong></summary>

Client override snippets go in `unlocked/client.lua`.

Server override snippets go in `unlocked/server.lua`.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How do I check what Bridge detected?</strong></summary>

Restart the server and review Bridge output in `F8` and the server console.

You can also use:

* `/fs_bridge_c` for client-side detection
* `fs_bridge_s` for server-side detection

</details>

<details>
